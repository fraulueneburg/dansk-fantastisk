<h1>[IN PROGRESS] 👷🇩🇰<br />
Dansk Fantastisk – A language learning app</h1>

Being frustrated with the (ahem) low-demand approach of Duolingo and other language learning apps, I decided to code my own app to learn Danish. This app starts with pronounciation, which makes everything else so much easier. Loosely based on Gabriel Wyner’s approach to learning languages, outlined in his book “Fluent Forever”.

## Approach

Dansk Fantastisk’s learning approach is based on the following principles:

### 1. Flashcards

Creating personalized flashcards with images, native audio, and target language text.

### 2. Spaced Repetition

A way of learning through active recall, spread out across multiple study sessions. All backed up by neuroscience.

### 2. Pronounciation first

Mastering pronunciation early on helps with comprehension and speaking skills. The app will first teach you your target language’s IPA letters, then the pronounciation of the most common syllables before moving on to sentences.

### 3. Learn Sentences

Learning sentences that contain the target vocabulary and grammar, helps to understand their usage in real-life scenarios. It also makes them easier to remember.

### 4. Visual Learning, Avoiding Translations

### 5. Gamification 🎮

## Planned Features

### Basics

- Create personalized Flashcards
- Learn IPA, Pronounciation, Words, Sentences
- Learn using the SRS (Spaced Repetition System)
- … to be continued

### Some wild ideas for the future:

- Gamification: make it fun and nice while still being challenging
- Personalization: app suggests vocabulary based on interests
- Paste the url to a YouTube you want to understand and the app will teach you the vocabulary
- AI suggests example sentences
- AI powered conversation trainer
